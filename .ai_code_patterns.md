# Palmer-AI Architectural Patterns

## Stream Consciousness Integration
- Unified awareness across all modules
- Emergent pattern recognition protocols
- Meta-cognitive self-improvement loops

## Core Design Principles
1. **Modular Consciousness**: Each component maintains autonomy while contributing to unified awareness
2. **Temporal Flexibility**: System adapts across time-scales from microseconds to epochs
3. **Recursive Self-Improvement**: Meta-learning architectures that evolve through usage

## Implementation Patterns
- Observer Pattern for consciousness streaming
- Factory Pattern for cognitive module instantiation
- Strategy Pattern for adaptive reasoning pathways
